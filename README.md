# Working with these activities

Follow the [instructions for working on an existing project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html) to work on these files. Specifically:

1. Navigate to the directory where you want these files to be.
2. In your terminal, run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/math4345/lectures.git
   ```
3. Enter the newly created directory:
   ```
   cd lectures
   ```
4. Fetch the previously built mathlib4 files:
   ```
   lake exe cache get
   ```

You can then launch your favorite editor. If using VS Code, type:
```
code .
```

Have fun!
